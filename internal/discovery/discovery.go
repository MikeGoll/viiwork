// Package discovery is viiwork's canonical answer to "what can this fleet
// serve, and how large a prompt may I send it".
//
// The market standardised the transport and never standardised discovery.
// OpenAI's GET /v1/models returns {id, object, created, owned_by} and nothing
// else — no window, no capabilities — so every coding client either ships a
// hardcoded table of models it knows or makes the user type the numbers in.
// Several projects are independently closing that gap right now, in mutually
// incompatible spellings of the same integer.
//
// viiwork is unusually well placed to answer, because every one of those
// formats assumes one host with one model loaded while a viiwork node already
// computes the minimum context across the hosts its router would route to.
// That number, not a checkpoint's architectural maximum, is what a client can
// safely size a prompt against.
//
// This package holds ONE record of it. The external spellings are thin
// serializers over this type and never state of their own: three formats that
// each assembled their own view would be three things to keep true, and the
// first one written would silently become the source of truth for the rest.
// A serializer may drop a field its format has no room for, and may supply a
// substitute for a field its format demands — but it may not invent a number
// and call it viiwork's.
