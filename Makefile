# === Docker builds ===
# One image per engine, under docker/. See BUILDS.md.
#
#   docker-rocm (alias: docker, docker-stable) -> viiwork:latest
#   docker-vllm                                 -> viiwork-vllm:latest
#   docker-freetoken                            -> viiwork-freetoken:latest
#
# One image per engine, all under docker/, named for the ENGINE rather than for
# a GPU vendor: Dockerfile.rocm is llama.cpp built for ROCm/gfx906, which is the
# engine the reference fleet runs. vLLM already has a ROCm build and FreeToken
# may add one, so a second accelerator backend is a sibling base image, never a
# fork.
#
# The two v2.2.0 images are not peers in cost. docker-vllm drops the binary into
# vLLM's published image and takes about a minute; docker-freetoken installs the
# engine, torch and its CUDA wheels into a devel CUDA base and is several GB.
# Build that one off-peak.
#
# VERSION must be passed through: the Dockerfile defaults ARG VERSION to "dev",
# so without this the image reports "dev" from /v1/cluster and /v1/status no
# matter what the tree is tagged — which is worst precisely on a release build,
# where the tag is the whole point.
#
# docker and docker-stable stay as aliases: scripts and habits use them, and
# Radeon VII is the core build, so the unqualified name pointing at it is
# right rather than merely convenient.
